[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mGlobal  [22mfinds locations of given symbols in C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP and
       Assembly source files, and prints the path name, line number  and  line
       image  of  the  locations.   [1mGlobal [22mcan locate not only definitions but
       also references and other symbols.

       [1mGlobal [22mcan treat a source tree, that is,  a  directory  that  has  sub-
       directories  and  source files, as a project.  In advance of using this
       command, you must execute [1mgtags[22m(1) at the root directory of the project
       which  you  want  to  investigate  to make tag files.  Then you can use
       [1mglobal [22mcommand anywhere in the project.  You need not specify where the
       tag file is.  Instead, [1mglobal [22mlocates it by itself.

       You  can  specify a regular expression for [4mpattern[24m.  [1mGlobal [22munderstands
       two different versions of regular expression syntax: basic and extended
       (default).

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       The following commands are available:

       <no command> [4mpattern[0m
              No  command means tag search command.  Print tags which match to
              [4mpattern[24m.  By default, print definition tags.

       [1m-c[22m, [1m--completion [22m[[4mprefix[24m]
              Print symbols which start with [4mprefix[24m.  If [4mprefix[24m is not  given,
              print all symbols.

       [1m-f[22m, [1m--file [4m[22mfiles[0m
              Print  all  tags  in  the  [4mfiles[24m.   This  command implies the [1m-x[0m
              option.

       [1m-g[22m, [1m--grep [4m[22mpattern[24m [[4mfiles[24m]
              Print all lines which match to the [4mpattern[24m.  If [4mfiles[24m are given,
              this command searches in those files.

       [1m--help [22mPrint a usage message.

       [1m-I[22m, [1m--idutils [4m[22mpattern[0m
              Print all lines which match to [4mpattern[24m.  This function uses [1midu-[0m
              [1mtils[22m(1) as a search engine.  To use this command,  you  need  to
              install  [1midutils[22m(1) in your system and execute [1mgtags[22m(1) with the
              [1m-I [22moption.

       [1m-P[22m, [1m--path [22m[[4mpattern[24m]
              Print path names which match  to  [4mpattern[24m.   If  no  pattern  is
              given, print all paths in the project.

       [1m-p[22m, [1m--print-dbpath[0m
              Print location of 'GTAGS'.

       [1m-u[22m, [1m--update[0m
              Update tag files incrementally.  This command internally invokes
              [1mgtags[22m(1).  You can execute this command anywhere in the project,
              differing from [1mgtags[22m(1).

       [1m--version[0m
              Show version number.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following options are available:

       [1m-a[22m, [1m--absolute[0m
              Print  absolute  path  names.  By  default,  print relative path
              names.

       [1m--color [4m[22mwhen[0m
              Use color to highlight the pattern within the line; [4mwhen[24m may  be
              one  of:  [4mnever[24m, [4malways[24m or [4mauto[24m (default).  The default color is
              bold red text on current background;  the  environment  variable
              [1mGREP_COLORS  [22m(only  [1mmt  [22mand  [1mms  [22mare  effective  at  present) or
              [1mGREP_COLOR [22mdefines it.  This option is effective to the  follow-
              ing commands: <no command>, -f, -g, -I, -P.

       [1m-d[22m, [1m--definition[0m
              Print locations of definitions.

       [1m-e[22m, [1m--regexp [4m[22mpattern[0m
              Use  [4mpattern[24m as the pattern; useful to protect patterns starting
              with '-'.

       [1m-E[22m, [1m--extended-regexp[0m
              Interpret [4mpattern[24m as a extended regular expression.  This is the
              default.

       [1m--encode-path [4m[22mchars[0m
              Convert  path characters in [4mchars[24m into a '%' symbol, followed by
              the two-digit hexadecimal representation of  the  character.   A
              blank will be converted to '%20'.

       [1m-F[22m, [1m--first-match[0m
              End the search without going through all the tag files listed in
              [1mGTAGSLIBPATH [22mwhen tags are found in a  tag  file.  This  is  the
              default.

       [1m--from-here [4m[22mcontext[0m
              Decide  tag type by [4mcontext[24m. Its syntax should be 'lineno:path'.
              If this option is specified then [1m-s [22mand [1m-r [22mare ignored.  Regular
              expression  is not allowed for [4mpattern[24m.  This option assumes use
              in conversational environments such as editors and IDEs.

       [1m-G[22m, [1m--basic-regexp[0m
              Interpret [4mpattern[24m as a basic regular expression.  The default is
              an extended regular expression.

       [1m--gtagsconf [4m[22mfile[0m
              Set environment variable [1mGTAGSCONF [22mto [4mfile[24m.

       [1m--gtagslabel [4m[22mlabel[0m
              Set environment variable [1mGTAGSLABEL [22mto [4mlabel[24m.

       [1m-i[22m, [1m--ignore-case[0m
              Ignore case distinctions in the pattern.

       [1m-L[22m, [1m--file-list [4m[22mfile[0m
              Obtain  files from [4mfile[24m in addition to the arguments.  The argu-
              ment [4mfile[24m can be set to '-' to accept a list of files  from  the
              standard input. File names must be separated by newline.

       [1m-l[22m, [1m--local[0m
              Print only tags which exist under the current directory.

       [1m--literal[0m
              Execute  literal  search  instead  of regular expression search.
              This option works with the tag search command,  [1m-g  [22mcommand,  [1m-P[0m
              command and [1m-I [22mcommand.

       [1m-M[22m, [1m--match-case[0m
              Search is case-sensitive. This is the default.

       [1m--match-part [4m[22mpart[0m
              Specify how path name completion should match, where [4mpart[24m is one
              of: 'first', 'last' or 'all' (default).  This  option  is  valid
              only with the [1m-c [22mcommand in conjunction with [1m-P[22m.

       [1m-n[22m, [1m--nofilter[0m
              Suppress sort filter and path conversion filter.

       [1m-N[22m, [1m--nearness[22m[=[4mstart[24m]
              Use  Nearness sort method for the output. By default, alphabeti-
              cal sort method is used.  This option is effective for  the  tag
              search  command,  [1m-P [22mcommand and [1m-g [22mcommand. As an exception, [1m-g[0m
              command ignores this option when files are  specified  by  argu-
              ments.   The  nearness is defined by how many parent directories
              to go up to reach the target. The result  of  nearness  sort  is
              concatenation  of  the  following  ([1]-[n])  in this order. The
              default of [4mstart[24m is the current directory.
              [1] Output of local search in the start directory.
              [2] Output of local search in the parent directory except for [1].
              [3] Output of local search in the grandparent directory except for [1]-[2].
              ... (repeat until the project root directory)
              [n] Output of local search in the project root directory except for [1]-[n-1].
              In each directory, they are sorted by alphabetical order.

       [1m-O[22m, [1m--only-other[0m
              Treat only text files other than  source  code,  like  'README'.
              This  option  is  valid  only  with  the [1m-g [22mor [1m-P [22mcommand.  This
              option overrides the [1m-o [22moption.

       [1m-o[22m, [1m--other[0m
              Treat not only source files  but  also  text  files  other  than
              source  code, like 'README'.  This option is valid only with the
              [1m-g [22mor [1m-P [22mcommand.

       [1m--path-style [4m[22mformat[0m
              Print path names using [4mformat[24m, which may be one of:  'relative',
              'absolute',  'shorter', 'abslib' or 'through'.  'relative' means
              relative path. 'absolute' means absolute path.  'shorter'  means
              the  shorter  one of relative and absolute path.  'abslib' means
              absolute path for libraries (GTAGSLIBPATH) and relative path for
              the  rest.   'through'  means the relative path from the project
              root directory (internal format of GPATH).  The default is 'rel-
              ative'.  The [1m--path-style [22moption is given more priority than the
              [1m-a [22moption.

       [1m--print0[0m
              Print each record followed by a null character instead of a new-
              line.

       [1m-q[22m, [1m--quiet[0m
              Quiet mode.

       [1m-r[22m, [1m--reference[22m, [1m--rootdir[0m
              Print reference tags.  Reference means the reference to a symbol
              which has definitions.  With  the  [1m-p  [22moption,  print  the  root
              directory of the project.

       [1m--result [4m[22mformat[0m
              Print  out  using [4mformat[24m, which may be one of: 'path' (default),
              'ctags', 'ctags-x', 'grep' or 'cscope'.  The [1m--result=ctags  [22mand
              [1m--result=ctags-x [22moptions are equivalent to the [1m-t [22mand [1m-x [22moptions
              respectively.  The [1m--result [22moption is given more  priority  than
              the [1m-t [22mand [1m-x [22moptions.

       [1m--single-update [4m[22mfile[0m
              Update tag files using [1mgtags[22m(1) with the [1m--single-update [22moption.
              It is considered that [4mfile[24m was added, updated  or  deleted,  and
              there  is  no change in other files.  This option implies the [1m-u[0m
              option.

       [1m-s[22m, [1m--symbol[0m
              Print other symbol tags.  Other symbol means the reference to  a
              symbol which has no definition.

       [1m-S[22m, [1m--scope [4m[22mdir[0m
              Print  only tags which exist under [4mdir[24m directory.  It is similar
              to the [1m-l [22moption, but you need not change directory.

       [1m-T[22m, [1m--through[0m
              Go through  all  the  tag  files  listed  in  [1mGTAGSLIBPATH[22m.   By
              default,  stop  searching  when  tag  is  found.  This option is
              ignored when either [1m-s[22m, [1m-r [22mor [1m-l [22moption is specified.

       [1m-t[22m, [1m--tags[0m
              Use standard ctags format.

       [1m-V[22m, [1m--invert-match[0m
              Invert the sense of  matching,  to  select  non-matching  lines.
              This option is valid only with the [1m-g [22mor [1m-P [22mcommands.

       [1m-v[22m, [1m--verbose[0m
              Verbose mode.

       [1m-x[22m, [1m--cxref[0m
              Use standard ctags cxref (with [1m-x[22m) format.
