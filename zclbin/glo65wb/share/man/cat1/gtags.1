[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mgtags [22m[-ciIOqvw][-d [4mtag-file[24m][-f [4mfile[24m][[4mdbpath[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mGtags [22mis used to create tag files for [1mglobal[22m(1).

       [1mGtags  [22mrecursively  collects  source files under the current directory,
       picks up symbols and writes the cross-reference data into the tag files
       ('GTAGS', 'GRTAGS' and 'GPATH').

       If 'gtags.files' exists in the current directory or a file is specified
       by the [1m-f [22moption, target files are limited by it. Lines  starting  with
       '. ' are comments.

       C, yacc, Assembly, Java, C++ and PHP source files are supported.  Files
       whose names end in '.c', '.h' are assumed to be C source files.   Files
       whose  names  end  in  '.y' are assumed to be yacc source files.  Files
       whose names end in '.s', '.S' are assumed to be Assembly source  files.
       Files  whose  names end in '.java' are assumed to be Java source files.
       Files whose names end in '.c++', '.cc', '.hh', '.cpp', '.cxx',  '.hxx',
       '.hpp',  '.C',  '.H'  are  assumed to be C++ source files.  Files whose
       names end in '.php', '.php3', '.phtml' are assumed  to  be  PHP  source
       files.   Other files are assumed to be text files. Gtags does not treat
       binary files.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following options are available:

       [1m--accept-dotfiles[0m
              Accept files and directories whose names begin with a  dot.   By
              default, [1mgtags [22mignores them.

       [1m-c[22m, [1m--compact[0m
              Make  'GTAGS' in compact format.  This option does not influence
              'GRTAGS', because that is always made in compact format.

       [1m--config[22m[=[4mname[24m]
              Print the value of config variable [4mname[24m.  If [4mname[24m is not  speci-
              fied  then print all names and values.  In addition to the vari-
              ables listed in  the  ENVIRONMENT  section,  you  can  refer  to
              install  directories  by  read  only  variables: [1mbindir[22m, [1mlibdir[22m,
              [1mdatadir[22m, [1mlocalstatedir [22mand [1msysconfdir[22m.

       [1m-d[22m, [1m--dump [4m[22mtag-file[0m
              Dump a tag file as text to the standard output. Output format is

       [1m--explain[0m
              Explain handling files.

       [1m-f[22m, [1m--file [4m[22mfile[0m
              Give a list of candidates of target files.  Files which are  not
              on the list are ignored.  The argument [4mfile[24m can be set to '-' to
              accept a list of files from the standard input.  File names must
              be  separated by newline.  To make the list you may use [1mfind[22m(1),
              which has rich options for selecting files.

       [1m--gtagsconf [4m[22mfile[0m
              Set environment variable [1mGTAGSCONF [22mto [4mfile[24m.

       [1m--gtagslabel [4m[22mlabel[0m
              Set environment variable [1mGTAGSLABEL [22mto [4mlabel[24m.

       [1m-I[22m, [1m--idutils[0m
              In addition to tag files, make ID database for [1midutils[22m(1).

       [1m-i[22m, [1m--incremental[0m
              Update tag files incrementally.  It's better  to  use  [1mglobal[22m(1)
              with the [1m-u [22mcommand.

       [1m-O[22m, [1m--objdir[0m
              Use BSD-style objdir as the location of tag files.  If '$MAKEOB-
              JDIRPREFIX' directory  exists,  [1mgtags  [22mcreates  '$MAKEOBJDIRPRE-
              FIX/<current  directory>'  directory  and makes tag files in it.
              If [4mdbpath[24m is specified, this option is ignored.

       [1m--single-update [4m[22mfile[0m
              Update tag files for a single file.  It is considered that  [4mfile[0m
              was  added,  updated or deleted, and there is no change in other
              files.  This option implies the [1m-i [22moption.

       [1m--skip-unreadable[0m
              Skip unreadable files.

       [1m--sqlite3[0m
              Use Sqlite 3 API to make tag files. By default, BSD/DB 1.85  API
              is  used.   To  use  this  option,  you need to invoke configure
              script with [1m--with-sqlite3 [22min the build phase.

       [1m--statistics[0m
              Print statistics information.

       [1m-q[22m, [1m--quiet[0m
              Quiet mode.

       [1m-v[22m, [1m--verbose[0m
              Verbose mode.

       [1m-w[22m, [1m--warning[0m
              Print warning messages.

       [4mdbpath[24m The directory in which tag files are generated.  The default  is
              the current directory.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       $ ls -F
       Makefile      src/    lib/
       $ gtags -v
       $ global -x main
       main              10 src/main.c  main (argc, argv) {

[1mFILES[0m
       'GTAGS'
              Tag file for definitions.

       'GRTAGS'
              Tag file for references.

       'GPATH'
              Tag file for source files.

       'gtags.conf', '$HOME/.globalrc'
              See [1mgtags.conf[22m(5).

       'gtags.files'
              The list of candidates of target files.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       The following environment variables affect the execution of [1mgtags[22m:

       [1mGTAGSCACHE[0m
              The size of the B-tree cache. The default is 50000000 (bytes).

       [1mGTAGSCONF[0m
              Configuration file.

       [1mGTAGSFORCECPP[0m
              If  this  variable  is  set,  each  file whose suffix is '.h' is
              treated as a C++ source file.

       [1mGTAGSFORCEENDBLOCK[0m
              If this variable is set, each } at the first column  brings  end
              of block of 0 level.

       [1mGTAGSLABEL[0m
              Configuration label. The default is 'default'.

       [1mGTAGSLOGGING[0m
              If  this  variable  is  set, '$GTAGSLOGGING' is used as the path
              name of a log file. There is no default value.

       [1mGTAGS_COMMANDLINE[0m
              This  variable  can  only  be  referenced  from  the  hook  (see
              gtags_hook).   [1mGtags [22msets its own effective command line to this
              variable before calling the hook. Each argument is separated  by
              whitespace, and real whitespace is represented as '%20'. This is
              read only.

       [1mGTAGS_OPTIONS[0m
              The value of this variable is inserted in the head of arguments.

       [1mMAKEOBJDIR[0m
              If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIR' is used as  the  name  of
              BSD-style objdir. The default is 'obj'.

       [1mMAKEOBJDIRPREFIX[0m
              If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' is used as the pre-
              fix of BSD-style objdir. The default is '/usr/obj'.

       [1mTMPDIR [22mThe location used to stored  temporary  files.  The  default  is
              '/tmp'.

[1mCONFIGURATION[0m
       The  following  configuration  variables affect the execution of [1mgtags[22m.
       You can see the default value  for  each  variable  with  the  [1m--config[0m
       option.

       gtags_parser (comma separated list)
              Specify the mapping of language names and plug-in parsers.  Each
              part delimited by the comma consists of  the  language  name,  a
              colon,  the  shared object path, an optional colon followed by a
              function name.  If the function name is not specified,  'parser'
              is  assumed.  As a special exception, [1mgtags [22mcollects values from
              multiple gtags_parser variables.

       gtags_hook (command line)
              Specify a command line which should be executed at the beginning
              of [1mgtags [22mafter loading configuration file. You can use this hook
              to update 'gtags.files' dynamically.  "./" in  it  always  means
              the project root directory, since [1mgtags [22mis always invoked there.

       icase_path (boolean)
              Ignore  case  distinctions  in  the  path.   Suffixes  check  is
              affected by this capability.

       langmap (comma separated list)
              Language mapping. Each comma-separated map consists of the  lan-
              guage  name,  a colon, and a list of file extensions.  As a spe-
              cial exception, [1mgtags  [22mcollects  values  from  multiple  langmap
              variables.  Default mapping is:
              'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.hh.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml'.

       skip (comma separated list)
              [1mGtags [22mskips files and directories which are given in this  list.
              As a special exception, [1mgtags [22mcollects values from multiple skip
              variables.  If the value ends with  '/',  it  is  assumed  as  a
              directory  and  [1mgtags  [22mskips  all files under it.  The value may
              include glob patterns (*, ?, [...], [!...], [^...]).

              If the value starts with '/', it is assumed a relative path name
              from the root directory of the project. You cannot use glob pat-
              terns for a path name. However, this direction  is  out-of-date,
              and is not recommended. Instead, you can use [1m-f [22moption which can
              be combined with [1mfind[22m(1). Since  [1mfind[22m(1)  has  rich  options  to
              select  files,  you  can do everything. Additionally, this tech-
              nique can also be applied to  any  other  tagging  systems  like
              [1mctags[22m(1), [1mcscope[22m(1), and etc.

              Skip   list   is   also   effective  when  you  use  the  [1m-f  [22mor
              'gtags.files'.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [1mGtags [22mexits with a non-0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

       Note that files created by [1mgtags [22mwith a non-zero exit  code  should  be
       considered corrupted.

[1mBUG[0m
       'GTAGS' and 'GRTAGS' are very large.  In advance of using this command,
       check the space of your disk.

       Assembly support is far from complete.  It extracts  only  ENTRY()  and
       ALTENTRY() from source file.  Probably valid only for FreeBSD and Linux
       kernel source.

       There is no concurrency control about tag files.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mgtags [22mcommand appeared in FreeBSD 2.2.2.
