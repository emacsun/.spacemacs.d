[1mNAME[0m
       gtags.conf - configuration data for GNU GLOBAL

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       'gtags.conf'
       '~/.globalrc'

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       'gtags.conf' has configuration data for [1mglobal[22m(1), [1mgozilla[22m(1), [1mgtags[22m(1)
       and [1mhtags[22m(1). They look for the following files in this order, and read
       from the first one that exists and is readable.

       (1) --gtagsconf [4mfile[0m

       (2) $GTAGSCONF

       (3) [project root]/gtags.conf

       (4) $HOME/.globalrc

       (5) /etc/gtags.conf

       (6) [sysconfdir]/gtags.conf

       [sysconfdir]  is  '/usr/local/etc' by default; you can change it by the
       --sysconfdir option of the configure script.

       Syntax is similar to [1mtermcap[22m(5) except for  some  extensions  described
       later.  A file includes one or more records. You should select a record
       using a label.  Default label is 'default'. If [1mGTAGSLABEL [22mis  set,  its
       value  is  used.  Please be aware the meaning of 'default' is different
       from that of [1mtermcap[22m(5).

       Lines starting with '#' are ignored.  A record consists of one or  more
       fields  separated by ':' and ends with a newline.  The first field must
       have a label name. Each field of the rest has  a  variable  definition.
       There are three types in those variables.

       Boolean:  This type has no value; existence of variable means true else
       false.

       Number: This type has a number value after '#'.

       String: This type has a string value after '='.
              Most variables are relevant to string type.

       If data includes ':' or newline, you need to quote it by '\'.  An empty
       field is permitted, but it doesn't make sense.

       When  there  is  more than one definition, the previous one is adopted.
       Exceptionally, all values of [1mskip[22m, [1mlangmap [22mand [1mgtags_parser [22mare adopted
       and connected respectively.

[1mVariable substitution[0m
       Variable  substitution similar to [1msh[22m(1) is available.  You can refer to
       any string variable using '$' prefix. For example, the following [1mb  [22mhas
       a value 'XYZ'.
       :a=Y:b=X${a}Z:

[1mIncluding another record[0m
       [1mTc  [22mis  a  special variable; it reads in definitions in another record.
       It is similar to the [1mtc [22mof [1mtermcap[22m(5).  Syntax is as follows:
       [1mtc[22m=[4mlabel[24m[@[4mfile[24m]
       If only a [4mlabel[24m is given, [1mtc [22mis read from a  record  specified  by  the
       [4mlabel[24m  in  the  same  file.  If  @[4mfile[24m is also given, [1mtc [22mis read from a
       record specified by the [4mlabel[24m in the specified [4mfile[24m.  [4mFile[24m should be an
       absolute  path, and should not include variables.  Different from [1mterm-[0m
       [1mcap[22m(5), you can use [1mtc [22manytime anywhere.

[1mCONFIGURATION[0m

       You can use the following environment variables as a  string  variable.
       If  these variables are set then environment variables of the same name
